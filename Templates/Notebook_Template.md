# Notebook Format


Before following the structure there are some important notes to keep in mind:
- We need to be able to communicate why this library is so imprortant
- Since this is beginners course, please explain all changes in the code (including function parameters).
- Add visual representations to your notebooks to explain ideas better. 
- **Now Try This** are the mini exercises for students, 
- You can take a look at this notebook for reference on how to explain and categorize things.
